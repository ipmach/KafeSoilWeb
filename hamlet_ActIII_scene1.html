  <p>    Claudius. And can you by no drift of circumstance
    <p>Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
    <p>Grating so harshly all his days of quiet 1685
    <p>With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?</p>
    <p>
    <p>Rosencrantz. He does confess he feels himself distracted,
    <p>But from what cause he will by no means speak.</p>
    <p>
    <p>Guildenstern. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
    <p>But with a crafty madness keeps aloof 1690
    <p>When we would bring him on to some confession
    <p>Of his true state.
      <p>
    <p>Gertrude. Did he receive you well?
      <p>
    <p>Rosencrantz. Most like a gentleman.
      <p>
    <p>Guildenstern. But with much forcing of his disposition. 1695
      <p>
    <p>Rosencrantz. Niggard of question, but of our demands
    <p>Most free in his reply.
      <p>
    <p>Gertrude. Did you assay him
    <p>To any pastime?
<p>
    <p>Rosencrantz. Madam, it so fell out that certain players 1700
    <p>We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
    <p>And there did seem in him a kind of joy
    <p>To hear of it. They are here about the court,
    <p>And, as I think, they have already order
    <p>This night to play before him. 1705
<p>
  <p>  Polonius. 'Tis most true;
    <p>And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
  <p>  To hear and see the matter.
<p>
    <p>Claudius. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
    <p>To hear him so inclin'd. 1710
    <p>Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
  <p>  And drive his purpose on to these delights.
<p>
    <p>Rosencrantz. We shall, my lord.
<p>
<p>Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
<p>
    <p>Claudius. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too; 1715
  <p>  For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
    <p>That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
    <p>Affront Ophelia.
    <p>Her father and myself (lawful espials)
    <p>Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen, 1720
  <p>  We may of their encounter frankly judge
  <p>  And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
    <p>If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
  <p>  That thus he suffers for.
<p>
  <p>  Gertrude. I shall obey you; 1725
  <p>  And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
  <p>  That your good beauties be the happy cause
  <p>  Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
  <p>  Will bring him to his wonted way again,
  <p>  To both your honours. 1730

  <p>  Ophelia. Madam, I wish it may.

<p>[Exit Queen.]

    <p>Polonius. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
  <p>  We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
  <p>  That show of such an exercise may colour 1735
  <p>  Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
  <p>  'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
  <p>  And pious action we do sugar o'er
  <p>  The Devil himself.
<p>
  <p>  Claudius. [aside] O, 'tis too true! 1740
  <p>  How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
  <p>  The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
  <p>  Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
  <p>  Than is my deed to my most painted word.
  <p>  O heavy burthen! 1745
<p>
    <p>Polonius. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
<p>
<p>Exeunt King and Polonius].
<p>
<p>Enter Hamlet.
<p>
  <p>  Hamlet. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
  <p>  Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer 1750
  <p>  The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
<p>    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
  <p>  And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
  <p>  No more; and by a sleep to say we end
<p>    The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks 1755
  <p>  That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
  <p>  Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
  <p>  To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
<p>    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
  <p>  When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, 1760
  <p>  Must give us pause. There's the respect
<p>    That makes calamity of so long life.
  <p>  For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
<p>    Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
  <p>  The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay, 1765
  <p>  The insolence of office, and the spurns
  <p>  That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
  <p>  When he himself might his quietus make
  <p>  With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
  <p>  To grunt and sweat under a weary life, 1770
  <p>  But that the dread of something after death-
  <p>  The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
  <p>  No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
  <p>  And makes us rather bear those ills we have
  <p>  Than fly to others that we know not of? 1775
  <p>  Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
  <p>  And thus the native hue of resolution
  <p>  Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
  <p>  And enterprises of great pith and moment
  <p>  With this regard their currents turn awry 1780
<p>    And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
  <p>  The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
<p>    Be all my sins rememb'red.
<p>
  <p>  Ophelia. Good my lord,
  <p>  How does your honour for this many a day? 1785
<p>
<p>    Hamlet. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
<p>
  <p>  Ophelia. My lord, I have remembrances of yours
  <p>  That I have longed long to re-deliver.
  <p>  I pray you, now receive them.
<p>
  <p>  Hamlet. No, not I! 1790
  <p>  I never gave you aught.
<p>
  <p>  Ophelia. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
  <p>  And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
  <p>  As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
  <p>  Take these again; for to the noble mind 1795
  <p>  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  <p>  There, my lord.
<p>
  <p>  Hamlet. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
<p>
  <p>  Ophelia. My lord?
<p>
  <p>  Hamlet. Are you fair? 1800
<p>
  <p>  Ophelia. What means your lordship?
<p>
  <p>  Hamlet. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
  <p>  discourse to your beauty.
<p>
  <p>  Ophelia. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
<p>
  <p>  Hamlet. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform 1805
  <p>  honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can
  <p>  translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox,
  <p>  but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
<p>
<p>    Ophelia. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
<p>
<p>    Hamlet. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so 1810
<p>    inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you
<p>    not.
<p>
<p>    Ophelia. I was the more deceived.
<p>
<p>    Hamlet. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
<p>    sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse 1815
  <p>  me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me.
  <p>  I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my
<p>    beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
<p>    them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I
<p>    do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves all; 1820
<p>    believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
<p>    father?
<p>
  <p>  Ophelia. At home, my lord.
<p>
<p>    Hamlet. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
<p>    nowhere but in's own house. Farewell. 1825
<p>
  <p>  Ophelia. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
<p>
<p>    Hamlet. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry:
<p>    be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape
<p>    calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
<p>    needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what 1830
<p>    monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
<p>    Farewell.
<p>
<p>    Ophelia. O heavenly powers, restore him!
<p>
<p>    Hamlet. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
<p>    given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you 1835
<p>    amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make your
<p>    wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath made
<p>    me mad. I say, we will have no moe marriages. Those that are
<p>    married already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep as
<p>    they are. To a nunnery, go. Exit. 1840
<p>
<p>    Ophelia. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
<p>    The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
<p>  Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
<p>    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
<p>    Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down! 1845
<p>    And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
<p>    That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
<p>    Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
<p>    Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
  <p>  That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth 1850
<p>    Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
<p>    T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
<p>
<p>Enter King and Polonius.
<p>
<p>    Claudius. Love? his affections do not that way tend;
<p>    Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little, 1855
<p>Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
<p>    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
<p>    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
<p>    Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
  <p>  I have in quick determination 1860
<p>    Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
<p>    For the demand of our neglected tribute.
<p>    Haply the seas, and countries different,
  <p>  With variable objects, shall expel
<p>    This something-settled matter in his heart, 1865
<p>    Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
<p>    From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
<p>
<p>    Polonius. It shall do well. But yet do I believe
<p>    The origin and commencement of his grief
<p>    Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia? 1870
  <p>  You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
<p>    We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
<p>    But if you hold it fit, after the play
<p>    Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
<p>    To show his grief. Let her be round with him; 1875
  <p>  And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
  <p>  Of all their conference. If she find him not,
<p>    To England send him; or confine him where
<p>    Your wisdom best shall think.
<p>
<p>    Claudius. It shall be so. 1880
<p>    Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go. Exeunt.
